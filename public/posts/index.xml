&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my first real blog post on this site. As tax season sneaks up on us, I thought it would be a great idea to start getting all my resources ready to streamline the painful experience of doing my taxes.

In this article I will cover picoCTF buffer-overflow1!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
